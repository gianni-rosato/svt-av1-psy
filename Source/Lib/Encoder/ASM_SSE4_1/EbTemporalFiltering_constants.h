// Division using multiplication and shifting. The C implementation does:
// modifier *= 3;
// modifier /= index;
// where 'modifier' is a set of summed values and 'index' is the number of
// summed values.
//
// This equation works out to (m * 3) / i which reduces to:
// m * 3/4
// m * 1/2
// m * 1/3
//
// by pairing the multiply with a down shift by 16 (_mm_mulhi_epu16):
// m * C / 65536
// we can create a C to replicate the division.
//
// m * 49152 / 65536 = m * 3/4
// m * 32758 / 65536 = m * 1/2
// m * 21846 / 65536 = m * 0.3333
//
// These are loaded using an instruction expecting int16_t values but are used
// with _mm_mulhi_epu16(), which treats them as unsigned.
