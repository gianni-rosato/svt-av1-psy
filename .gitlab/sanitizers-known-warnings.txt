#List of known warnings for CI task Sanitizer(thread-skip-known-warnings)
#CI runs sanitizer with skip known warnings to detect regression of new potential issues.
#Known warnings are tracked in issue: #1308

#Race warnings (data races and use-after-free reports):
#1]
race:svt_memcpy_small
race:svt_memcpy_sse
race:mode_decision_kernel
#mode_decision_kernel() is run two times with that same pcs_ptr in separated tasks,
#when: enc_dec_tasks_ptr->input_type is ENCDEC_TASKS_MDC_INPUT or ENCDEC_TASKS_ENCDEC_INPUT.
#Some calculation are done double on that same memory.
#Example for one of the warnings is to change in mode_decision_kernel:
#((EbReferenceObject *)
#     pcs_ptr->parent_pcs_ptr->reference_picture_wrapper_ptr->object_ptr)
#    ->average_intensity = pcs_ptr->parent_pcs_ptr->average_intensity[0];
#to:
#if (ENCDEC_TASKS_MDC_INPUT == input_type) {
#    ((EbReferenceObject *)
#         pcs_ptr->parent_pcs_ptr->reference_picture_wrapper_ptr->object_ptr)
#        ->average_intensity = pcs_ptr->parent_pcs_ptr->average_intensity[0];
#}
