# SVT-AV1-PSY

SVT-AV1-PSY is the Scalable Video Technology for AV1 (SVT-AV1 Encoder and Decoder) with perceptual enhancements for psychovisually optimal AV1 encoding. The goal is to create the best encoding implementation for perceptual quality with AV1.

### Feature Additions

- `--variance-boost-strength` *1 to 4* (**[Merged to Mainline](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/-/merge_requests/2195)**)

Provides control over our augmented AQ Modes 0 and 2 which can utilize variance information in each frame for more consistent quality under high/low contrast scenes. Four curve options are provided, and the default is curve 2. 1: mild, 2: gentle, 3: medium, 4: aggressive

- `--variance-octile` *1 to 8* (**[Merged to Mainline](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/-/merge_requests/2195)**)

Controls how "selective" the algorithm is when boosting superblocks, based on their low/high 8x8 variance ratio. A value of 1 is the least selective, and will readily boost a superblock if only 1/8th of the superblock is low variance. Conversely, a value of 8 will only boost if the *entire* superblock is low variance. Lower values increase bitrate. The default value is 6.

- `--enable-alt-curve` *0 and 1*

Enable an alternative variance boost curve, with different bit allocation and visual characteristics. The default is 0.

- `Presets -2 & -3`

Terrifically slow encoding modes for research purposes.

- `Tune 3`

A new tune based on Tune 2 (SSIM) called SSIM with Subjective Quality Tuning. Generally harms metric performance in exchange for better visual fidelity.

- `Tune 4`

Another new tune based on Tune 2 (SSIM) called Still Picture. Optimized for still images based on SSIMULACRA2 performance on the CID22 Validation test set. Not recommended for use outside of all-intra encoding.

- `--sharpness` *-7 to 7*

A parameter for modifying loopfilter deblock sharpness and rate distortion to improve visual fidelity. The default is 0 (no sharpness).

- `--dolby-vision-rpu` *path to file*

Set the path to a Dolby Vision RPU for encoding Dolby Vision video. SVT-AV1-PSY needs to be built with the `enable-libdovi` flag enabled in build.sh (see `./Build/linux/build.sh --help` for more info) (Thank you @quietvoid !)

- `Progress 3`

A new progress mode that provides more detailed information about the encoding process.

- `--fgs-table` *path to file* (**[Merged to Mainline](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/-/commit/ae7ce1abc5f3f7913624f728ae123f8b8c1e30de)**)

Argument for providing a film grain table for synthetic film grain (similar to aomenc's '--film-grain-table=' argument).

- `Extended CRF`

Provides a more versatile and granular way to set CRF. Range has been expanded to 70 (from 63) to help with ultra-low bitrate encodes, and can now be set in quarter-step (0.25) increments.

- `--qp-scale-compress-strength` *0 to 3*

Increases video quality temporal consistency, especially with clips that contain film grain and/or contain fast-moving objects.

- `--enable-dlf 2`

Enables a more accurate loop filter that prevents blocking, for a modest increase in compute time (most noticeable at presets 7 to 9).

- `Higher-quality presets for 8K and 16K`

Lowers the minimum available preset from 8 to 2 for higher-quality 8K and 16K encoding (64 GB of RAM recommended per encoding instance).

- `--frame-luma-bias` *0 to 100*

Enables frame-level luma bias to improve quality in dark scenes by adjusting frame-level QP based on average luminance across each frame.

- `--max-32-tx-size` *0 and 1*

Restricts available transform sizes to a maximum of 32x32 pixels. Can help slightly improve detail retention at high fidelity CRFs.

- `--adaptive-film-grain` *0 and 1*

Adaptively varies the film grain blocksize based on the resolution of the input video. Often greatly improves the consistency of film grain in the output video, reducing grain patterns.

- `--hdr10plus-json` *path to file*

Set the path to an HDR10+ JSON file for encoding HDR10+ video. SVT-AV1-PSY needs to be built with the `enable-hdr10plus` flag enabled in build.sh (see `./Build/linux/build.sh --help` for more info) (Thank you @quietvoid !)

- `--tf-strength` *0 to 4*

Manually adjust temporal filtering strength to adjust the trade-off between fewer artifacts in motion and fine detail retention. Each increment is a 2x increase in temporal filtering strength; the default value of 1 is 4x weaker than mainline SVT-AV1's default temporal filter (which would be equivalent to 3 here).

- `--chroma-qm-min` & `--chroma-qm-max` *0 to 15*

Set the minimum & maximum quantization matrices for chroma planes. The defaults are 8 and 15, respectively. These options decouple chroma quantization matrix control from the luma quantization matrix options currently available, allowing for more control over chroma quality.

- `Odd dimension encoding support`

Allows the encoder to accept content with odd width and/or height (e.g. 1920x817px). Gone are the "Source Width/Height must be even for YUV_420 colorspace" messages.

- `Reduced minimum width/height requirements`

Allows the encoder to accept content with width and/or height as small as 4 pixels (e.g. 32x18px).

- `--noise-norm-strength` *0 to 4*

In a scenario where a video frame contains areas with fine textures or flat regions, noise normalization helps maintain visual quality by boosting certain AC coefficients. The default value is 0, but it is enabled at strength 3 when using Tune 3.

### Modified Defaults

SVT-AV1-PSY has different defaults than mainline SVT-AV1 in order to provide better visual fidelity out of the box. They include:

- Default 10-bit color depth when given a 10-bit input.
- Disable film grain denoising by default, as it often harms visual fidelity. (**[Merged to Mainline](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/-/commit/8b39b41df9e07bbcdbd19ea618762c5db3353c03)**)
- Default to Tune 2 (SSIM) instead of Tune 1 (PSNR), as it reliably outperforms Tune 1 perceptually & throughout trusted metrics.
- Enable quantization matrices by default.
- Set minimum QM level to 0 by default.
- `--enable-variance-boost` enabled by default.

### Other Changes

- `--color-help`

Prints the information found in Appendix A.2 of the user guide in order to help users more easily understand the Color Description Options in SvtAv1EncApp.

- `Micro-Releases`

We are always continuously improving SVT-AV1-PSY, and we always recommend using the `master` branch to experience exciting new features as soon as they can be considered usable. To make our feature additions more clear, micro-release tags indicate when significant new feature additions have been made. Micro-release tags are letters starting with `A`, so new releases will be tagged as `v#.#.#-A`, `v#.#.#-B`, etc.

- `Enhanced Content Detection`

Tune 4 features a smarter content detection algorithm to optimize the encoder for either screen or photographic content based on the image. This helps Tune 4 achieve better visual fidelity on still images.
